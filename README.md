# Advent of Code 2022

Code for Advent of Code 2022. I am trying to do the problems in Ocaml this year to learn something new!

Not sure how far into the month I'll get, most years I only last a week or so until the time to do the problem grows and the time I have available shrinks (due to Christmas/end of year events). Still, it's a good opportunity to do some fun problems, learn something new, and push myself to think a different way.
